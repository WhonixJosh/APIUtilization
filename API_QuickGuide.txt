API Quick Guide(RapidAPI) 
Joshua Green

************************************************

This guide has been developed to aid first time users in understanding what are APIs 
and how to implement them. 

APIs(Application Programing Interface) allow for applications to interact with external
services through commandlets. This saves time in code development by not "reinventing the wheel"
on functions a program needs by porting them over from existing software.

This guided walkthrough takes the route of API's from RapidAPI.com and a more comprehensive guide can be found here:

Set-Up:

Step 1: Acquire API Key for API of choice. This will be checked by the API you want to call with each request to check against its directory 
of authorized users.

Step 2: Test the API endpoints to ensure that the API is actually accessable.

Step 3: Create an app for the API. Whether this is a web page, program, application, etc. some space where you can make the API requests
to retrieve back data is necessary.

Testing:

Using an API from RapidAPI.com we can easily acquire open-source API keys and endpoints as well as code snippets that can be used in our own projects.
